- Whitelist mode for only adding specific apps
- More intuitive radio buttons layout
- Settings pages to prevent redundant directory selection
- Path check to prevent overwriting the wrong directories

## Credits
Inspired from [ES AppLauncher](https://github.com/schattenphoenix/es_applauncher), though obviously entirely made by myself since the former is close-source
